Key Features:
Array Sorting and Sum Calculation:

Prompts the user to input an array size and its elements.
Sorts the array elements in descending order using an efficient algorithm.
Calculates the sum of the array elements.
Outputs the sorted array and its sum in a well-formatted manner.
Text Conversion to Title Case:

Allows the user to input a text string.
Converts the string to Title Case by capitalizing the first letter of each word.
Counts and displays the total number of words in the input text.
User-Friendly Menu:

Offers a menu-driven interface with options for array sorting, text conversion, and exit.
Keeps running until the user chooses to exit, ensuring continuous usability.
Highlights:
The program is meticulously organized with modular procedures for tasks like input handling, sorting, and text conversion, ensuring clarity and reusability.
Designed with performance and optimization in mind, making it an excellent example of 8086 Assembly programming.
Includes comprehensive comments and documentation within the code for easier understanding and analysis.
How it Works:
The user selects an option from the menu:
Array Sorting: Input an array, sort it, calculate the sum, and display results.
Title Case Conversion: Input a sentence, convert it, count words, and display the formatted sentence.
Exit: Terminates the program.
